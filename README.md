## A simple neovim config 
Written in lua and using [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) to manage plugins. Supported features:
* Autocompletion and snippets
* Fuzzy finding
* Fast commenting
* LSP 
* Treesitter syntax highlighting
* And hybrid line numbers for blazingly fast jumping between lines


### Key files
**init.lua** is the main config file. An older config written in vimscript and using the [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) plugin manager is provided in the vimconfig directory. **Note:** this is no longer used but should still work perfectly fine.
